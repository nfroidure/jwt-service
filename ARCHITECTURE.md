## JWT service

This JWT service is a simple wrapper around the `jsonwebtoken` NPM
 module. It add a level of abstraction simply providing a way to
 sign and verify JSON Web Tokens in my apps.

It also cast error to `YError` ones and adds a tolerance for expired
 tokens so that clock drifts between instances won't be a problem.
It also uses `Knifecycle` for a drop in dependency injection
 support in projetcs using Knifecycle.

Finally, it deal with promises which are more convenient than the
 original API.
